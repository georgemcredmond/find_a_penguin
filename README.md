# find_a_penguin
JavaScript "Find-A-Penguin" Game

9 mounds of snow. 8 penguins, 1 yeti! Can you find all the penguins before the yeti ends your game...and your life???

Each load of the page will randomize which mound of snow hides the yeti.
The new "Play Again" button will also restart the game.

Includes sound, so turn up the volume!

More features to come such as a score keeping element and conditions to beat the yeti and survive...

I don't even remember where I stole the graphics from...but credit to whomever it was out there that made them 4 years ago..
